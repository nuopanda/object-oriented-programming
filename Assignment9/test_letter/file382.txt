Dear Mitsue Scipione,

As you may have heard or read, last month we learned that criminals forced their way into our systems, 
and stole information about our customers. Late last week, as part of our ongoing investigation, 
we learned that the taken information includes names, mailing addresses, phone numbers or email addresses. 

I am writing to make you aware that your name, mailing address, phone number or email address may 
have been taken during the intrusion. 

I am truly sorry this incident occurred, and I sincerely regret any inconvenience it may cause you. 

To protect your information, we strongly advise you to make sure that you update your primary phone number 530-986-9272 
and secondary phone number 530-399-3254 through our website, and run a security check on your personal website 
http://www.studentsinfreeentrprsnatl.com to ensure information securiy.

Because we value you as a customer, and because your trust is important to us, our company is offering you 
one year of free credit monitoring through ProtectMyID product, which includes identity theft insurance 
where available. You will need to go to the website www.creditmonitor.com and type in you name Mitsue Scipione, 
physical address 77 222 Dr, zipcode 95965, state CA to activate the plan. During the activation process, 
we will need you to verify your primary phone number 530-986-9272 and personal email address mscipione@scipione.com. Please be 
sure you have access to these accounts in the verification process. You can also add your website http://www.studentsinfreeentrprsnatl.com after you activated 
this plan so that your website will be insured by this plan.
